The future of AI in Coding
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has left quite an impact on our lives in recent years, and the field of coding is no exception. In this post, we will explore the future possibilities of AI in programming, including the automation of coding and the role of AI in detecting and correcting errors in code.



## Code

### Styled (with Syntax)

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
